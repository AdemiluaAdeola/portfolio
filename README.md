# Portfolio — Ademilua Adeola

This is a simple, responsive portfolio website built with **pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. It is set up as a dark / modern style and highlights backend engineering, AI engineering and the user's medical background.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — small interactivity (nav toggle, copy email, year)

## How to use
1. Create a folder for the project and save `index.html`, `styles.css` and `script.js` into it.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.

## Deploy
### GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo (e.g., `portfolio`).
2. Commit the files and push to GitHub.
3. In repo settings → Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)`.

### Netlify / Vercel
- Drag and drop the project folder to Netlify (or connect the repo) to deploy.

## Customization
- Replace the project links in the Projects section with your real GitHub URLs and live demo links.
- Add a `favicon.ico` and a `profile.jpg` to the project root and update `index.html` to reference them.
- If you want contact form submissions to go to a server instead of `mailto:`, update the form `action` to your backend endpoint and handle POST requests.
